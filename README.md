# REACT
# A react application

# Project design gotten from https://www.uidesigndaily.com/ 

# A birthday remainder application built with react

This application was built using useState-Hook with the data stored locally.

In the code, I commented out using props to solve the same thing useState-Hook was able to solve.


Basically, This app gets the data stroed in json format(Objects) and presents it on the screen in html(jsx) format using react.

Included in the data is random name, age and Image of 5 different people. Image sorce from cloudinary.com, name and age - RANDOM.

At the last part of the application, there is a button that clears all the data projected on the screen. 

The button makes use of the function from the useState-Hook to clear the page.

Using onClick function to call a function that sets the useState data function into an emtpy array.
